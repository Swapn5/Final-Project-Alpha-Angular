             <p>The maximum amount of loan that you can avail to buy a car will vary from lender to
                lender. Most banks offer financing up to 90% of the on-road price of the car but there are some
                                    banks such as HDFC Bank, etc., that offers financing for up to 100% of the car's on-road

                                    future. However, most banks will allow the pre-payment option after you have chalked off
                                    6 months on your loan tenure. Plus, you will be expected to pay a

                Below this score, lenders may be reluctant to lend to you as it indicates your low
                repayment capacity.
                Some banks may offer you a car loan despite your low credit score but they may charge a
                higher interest rate.</p>

                These lenders offer car loans for up to 85% of the car's value provided that the car is
                not more than 5 years old.

              <ng-template matStepLabel><b>What will lenders look for when I apply for a car loan?</b></ng-template>
            <p>One of the most important factors that lenders consider before offering you a car loan is
                your credit score.
                As stated above, a credit score of above 750 can fetch you lower interest rates and
                other benefits.
                The other factors that lenders look for when you apply for a car loan are your
                employment status,
                residence and job stability, income, debt-to-income ratio, etc.</p>

              <ng-template matStepLabel><b>What is the lowest EMI that I need to pay for a car loan?</b></ng-template>
            <p> The amount of EMI (equated monthly instalments) that you will be paying towards your car
                loan will depend on the interest rate,
                loan amount, and the repayment tenure you choose. You can calculate the EMI by using the
                EMI Calculator tool available on the BankBazaar website.
                For example, let us suppose that you avail a car loan of Rs.1 lakh at an interest rate
                of 12% for a tenure of 5 years. Using the tool,
                we calculated the EMI and found it to be Rs.2,224.</p>

              <ng-template matStepLabel><b>How much down payment do I need to make to buy a car?</b></ng-template>
            <p> Making a higher down payment will mean that you will need to avail a lower loan amount to
                buy a car.
                When you avail a lower loan amount, there are chances that banks or lenders may offer
                you a car loan at
                lower interest rates. This is simply because if the loan amount is lower, the repayment
                will be quicker.
                So, though there is no hard and fast rule to how much down payment you should make, a
                higher down payment
                will ensure that your debt liability is lesser. </p>

            <p>If your credit score is above 750, you can negotiate with the banks to offer you a car
                loan at a lower interest rate.
                Many lenders will let you negotiate on the interest rates since your high credit score
                is an indication of your high repayment capacity.
                Some lenders may also offer you a waiver on the processing fee if you have a good credit
                score.</p>
